## Leadership & Administration

Alongside my academic work, I bring extensive experience in institutional leadership, program coordination, and organizational administration across educational, ecclesial, and nonprofit contexts. My leadership practice has been shaped by work in South Asia and the United States, often within settings that bridge scholarship, formation, and public engagement.

### Areas of Leadership Experience
My administrative and leadership work has included:
- Program coordination and academic administration  
- Conference, seminar, and public event planning  
- Faculty, student, and participant engagement  
- Curriculum planning and educational oversight  
- Cross-cultural and inter-institutional collaboration  

### Administrative Orientation
I approach leadership as a form of service that integrates institutional vision with practical execution. My administrative style emphasizes clarity of communication, collaborative decision-making, and sustainable structures that support both people and programs. I am particularly attentive to the relational dimensions of leadership in multicultural and mission-driven institutions.

### Institutional Engagement
My leadership experience has included working closely with faculty, students, clergy, and organizational partners in contexts that require sensitivity to theological diversity, cultural difference, and organizational complexity. This background informs my interest in roles that combine academic work with program development, administration, and public-facing institutional leadership.
