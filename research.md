My research examines the development of Indian evangelicalism in the decades following India’s independence, focusing on the interaction between indigenous Christian leadership and global evangelical networks. Situated within the fields of World Christianity and the history of evangelicalism, my work explores how Indian evangelicals negotiated questions of identity, mission, and institutional cooperation during the mid-twentieth century.

Focusing on the period between 1950 and 1974, my dissertation employs archival research and historical analysis to situate Indian evangelical movements within broader transnational currents. By examining the interplay between local agency and international exchange, this project contributes to ongoing scholarly conversations on global evangelicalism, postcolonial Christianity, and modern Christian movements.
