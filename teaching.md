## Teaching & Engagement

I view teaching as a collaborative process of knowledge-making that invites students to engage deeply with religious traditions, histories, and communities. My goal is to cultivate classrooms where students learn to think critically, read attentively, and see religion not only as a body of ideas but also as a lived and transformative force in society.

My pedagogical approach has been shaped by experiences as both a student and teacher in South Asia, Western Europe, and North America. In practice, my teaching emphasizes active student participation, collaborative discussion, and close engagement with texts. I design learning experiences that balance canonical works with lesser-heard voices, helping students move beyond familiar categories and attend to perspectives shaped by colonialism, racism, gender, and class.

### Teaching Commitments
- **Collaborative learning** through discussion-centered, student-participatory classrooms  
- **Close reading and historical contextualization** of primary texts and traditions  
- **Attentiveness to marginalized voices**, connecting scholarship to questions of justice and human dignity  

### Selected Teaching Practices
- Integrating experiential learning and context-based encounters with religious communities  
- Guiding students through assignments that cultivate analysis, synthesis, and independent thought  
- Fostering a rigorous yet welcoming classroom culture grounded in dialogue, curiosity, and trust  

### Mentorship and Engagement
Mentorship, academic advising, and supporting students’ growth beyond the classroom are integral to my vocation as an educator. I engage audiences in academic and public settings through seminars, moderated conversations, and invited talks related to global Christianity, religious history, and religion in public life.
