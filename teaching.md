## Teaching & Engagement

I view teaching as a collaborative process of knowledge-making that invites students to engage deeply with religious traditions, histories, and communities. My goal is to cultivate classrooms where students learn to think critically, read attentively, and understand religion not only as a body of ideas but also as a lived and historically embedded reality.

My pedagogical approach has been shaped by academic and teaching experiences across South Asia, Europe, and North America. In practice, my teaching emphasizes discussion-centered learning, close engagement with texts, and historical contextualization. I design courses that balance canonical materials with marginalized voices, helping students attend to how religion intersects with power, culture, and social change.

### Courses Taught *(selected)*
The following courses represent a selection of my teaching experience and areas of instructional competence:

- Modern Religious and Secular Movements  
- History of Christianity in the World  
- History of Christianity in India  
- Old Testament Survey  
- Research Methodology  
- Spiritual Practices  

### Teaching Commitments
- **Collaborative, discussion-driven classrooms** that emphasize student participation  
- **Close reading and historical analysis** of primary texts and traditions  
- **Global and contextual perspectives**, with attention to colonialism, modernity, and lived religion  

### Engagement Beyond the Classroom
In addition to formal teaching, I engage academic, church, and public audiences through seminars, moderated conversations, and invited lectures. Mentorship and academic advising are integral to my work as an educator, particularly in supporting students as they develop critical skills, intellectual confidence, and vocational clarity.
